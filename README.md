# Monitoring and Observability for AI Agents

This repository contains a research project focused on building a pipeline for monitoring and observability. The primary goal is to route alerts and logs from a standard observability stack (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus) to an AI agent. The AI agent will then process this information, generate remediation suggestions, and forward a comprehensive alert to a designated communication channel.

## Architecture Overview

The system uses Docker to containerize the following components:
* **Shoehub Application**: A sample application that generates stimulated logs.
* **Loki**: A log aggregation system for collecting and querying logs.
* **Promtail**: An agent that ships logs from the application to Loki.
* **Prometheus**: A monitoring system for metrics and alerting.
* **Grafana**: A visualization dashboard for viewing logs and metrics.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the local environment.

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deeepak-tyagii/monitoring-observability-ai-agents.git
    cd monitoring-observability-ai-agents
    ```

2.  **Launch the Environment:**
    Navigate to the `docker` directory and execute the `docker-compose.sh` script. This will build and start all the necessary services.
    ```bash
    cd docker
    sudo sh docker-compose.sh
    ```
    This command will spin up the shoehub application along with the complete observability stack.

## Configuration

The primary configuration files are located within their respective service folders:

* **Promtail**: The configuration file (`config.yml`) can be found in the `loki` directory. This file defines how logs are discovered and sent to Loki.
* **Prometheus**: The configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) is located in the `prometheus` folder. It contains the scrape configurations and alerting rules.

## Log Generation & Verification

### Generating Custom Error Logs
To generate additional log data, particularly error logs for testing purposes:
1.  Navigate to the `loki` directory.
2.  Run the `log-gen.py` Python script.
    ```bash
    cd loki
    python log-gen.py
    ```

### Viewing Logs in Grafana
1.  Open your web browser and go to the Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Use the default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) to log in, unless configured otherwise.
3.  Navigate to the **Explore** section from the left-hand menu.
4.  Select the **Loki** data source from the dropdown at the top.
5.  Use LogQL queries to find the relevant logs. You can search using labels:
    * For logs from the main application: `{job="shoehub"}`
    * For logs generated by the script: `{job="app"}`
